To understand how access works in Huma you can think of it in two levels.  (1) Personal level: Control access to view and manage a user's personal information. - that's what we call User roles (2) System level: Control access to system wide functionality - like people, news and settings++. Thats what we call 'System roles'. User roles: Ensure everyone in the organisation have the correct access. We have default  user roles that define what everyone without extended access can do on their  own profile and on other profiles. Standard roles are roles everyone has. Use these to set the base access level for what everyone can see and do on their own and other people’s profiles. 'On their own profile' - What can everyone see and manage on their own profile, 'On other people's profiles...' - What can everyone see and manage on their colleagues’ profiles"
