{"prompt":"How to manage accress roles ->","completion":" In Huma we care about everyone's privacy and therefore we have a very flexible approach regarding permission and access roles. Everyone shouldn't see everything. To understand how access works in Huma you can think of it in two levels.  (1) Personal level: Control access to view and manage a user's personal information. - that's what we call User roles (2) System level: Control access to system wide functionality - like people, news and settings++. Thats what we call 'System roles'. User roles: Ensure everyone in the organisation have the correct access. We have default  user roles that define what everyone without extended access can do on their  own profile and on other profiles. Standard roles are roles everyone has. Use these to set the base access level for what everyone can see and do on their own and other people’s profiles. 'On their own profile' - What can everyone see and manage on their own profile, 'On other people's profiles...' - What can everyone see and manage on their colleagues’ profiles\n"}
{"prompt":"How to give extended access over other people's profile ->","completion":" To give extended access over other people’s profile you can create or change a user role. We have added locked roles called 'Manager' and 'Payroll manager'. You can check locked permissions for these roles and use them or create a new user role with specific access. These roles can be granted to a person over members of teams, locations or over everyone in the organization. Then the granted person will have the defined permissions over the members in that team, location or everyone. Notice: user with multiple roles will have combined permissions from every role.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can I change name and Huma domain ->","completion":" You can change the name of the organisation and the Huma domain - the url to your organisation.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can I upload a logo ->","completion":" The space for the logo available is 200px * 40px on web. That’s the space we have available for the customers logo in menu topbar on web and in the contract. You can create a transparent PNG \/ SVG with the logo within the defined frame.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the recommended logo format ->","completion":" And we recommend clients to upload a logo in SVG (vector format that’s not based on pixels) OR a @3x png (three times the size of logo displayed) to get a crisp and sharp one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Can I Create legal employment contracts ->","completion":" Remember that only users with the system role Admin or User admin can create employee contracts. The permission that is required is Users > General > Full access. Start by clicking 'New  employment contract'. Consider if you want to create the contract based on Norwegian, Finnish or Swedish legislation. Start from scratch or connect it to user already added to Huma\n"}
{"prompt":"How to measure employee satisfaction ->","completion":" eNPS is an easy way to measure employee satisfaction and loyalty. It's based on asking an employee how likely they would be to recommend your workplace to others. Based one simple question ('On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work?') eNPS = employee Net Promoter Score\n"}
{"prompt":"What is eNPS ->","completion":" eNPS is an easy way to measure employee satisfaction and loyalty. It's based on asking an employee how likely they would be to recommend your workplace to others. Based one simple question ('On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work?') eNPS = employee Net Promoter Score\n"}
{"prompt":"Can you create handbooks in Huma ->","completion":" Handbooks in Huma are easy to create, easy to use and easy to maintain. In Huma you have ONE handbook. In the Handbook there are topics and they are grouped in categories. Each topic can be shared with either everyone or member of specific teams or locations. Employees will only see the topics that is shared with them. A topic can either be Draft or Published. Categories will only be displayed if it contains at least one published topic. The Handbook must be published for employees to be able to see the content that is shared with them.\n"}

Choose if the one or more of the following is required when registering - Start date (i.e. when did the employee receive the equipment) - End date (i.e. if you periodically change the equipment) - Documentation (if you want invoices\/receipts as documentation)\n"}
{"prompt":"How to publish News in Huma ->","completion":" When you press publish you can choose if it should be published to everyone in your company or if it only should be published to a specific team\/location.

With Huma's task function, you can easily plan and carry out the entire HR year with each individual employee. Employee interviews, to-do lists in connection with new hires, check-ins, salary interviews and employee surveys - no matter how you choose to set up the year, Huma helps you with an overview and reminders.\n"}
{"prompt":"How to work with custom profile fields ->","completion":" You can use custom profile fields to add additional information about your employees beyond the standard default fields provided in Huma. Some examples are: Shirt size, Medical information, License plate\n"}
{"prompt":"How to work with sick leave follow-up ->","completion":" The follow-up process differs between countries. Huma bases the process on which work schedule the employee is assigned to. At this point we support follow-up processes for Sweden and Norway. The process is started when the employee register a Sick leave absence, and ended when the Sick leave absence is ended. During the process, Huma will assign tasks to the responsible regarding important steps. Such as follow-up plan and dialogue meetings or reporting to Altinn\/Försäkringskassan. Besides these legislation based tasks, Huma will send tasks once a week to remind them of checking up on the employee.\n"}
{"prompt":"How to work with digital signing in Huma ->","completion":" You need a System Role Digital signing to send documents for digital signing. The default Admin role has this activated. We offer the following for Huma Business and Huma Enterprise subscribers.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is Huma? ->","completion":" Huma is smarter and better HR software that people actually use\n"}
{"prompt":"WHat is the core of Huma? ->","completion":" When employee administration is done right (and is easy) it provides real value for both company and employee. Collect all employee data, documents and processes in one place. Everyone has access to what they need (and nothing more).\n"}
{"prompt":"What does it cost ->","completion":" Free: Because everyone deserves great HR, Free. Business: When you want a little more, € 4.99 per person \/ month. Enterprise: When you want all the features Huma provide, € 9.99 per person \/ month\n"}
{"prompt":"Why Huma exists ->","completion":" Huma saw the light of day because the average person spends more than ⅓ of their life at work, and we want to make that part of life better, smarter and more enjoyable. We interviewed hundreds of managers, HR managers and employees throughout the last year. What we learned is that businesses and all the people working there deserve more intuitive, inspiring and intelligent technology to aid the most important resource: you.\n"}
{"prompt":"WHat are Humas beliefs ->","completion":" Huma's technology is developed with one simple philosophy: the service needs to be used by everyone to create value. We believe that today's HR softwares are made to solve problems in HR and not to aid every person at work. It results in something most of us know to much about: an expensive and unused software. Huma is here to challenge what an HR software can be. Our system has new and unique features which helps better workplace culture and engagement. Huma lifts your HR to more than a supporting service.\n"}
{"prompt":"Now that you have been using Huma for a while, what has surprised you? ->","completion":" How carrying out HR tasks can be infinitely easier if you have a good program! \n"}
{"prompt":"You have integrated Huma with Slack; what do you get out of that? ->","completion":" That’s right, we have connected with Slack. I must say it works really well! It means you can receive notifications and can keep track of what’s going on.\n"}
{"prompt":"What made you decide to choose Huma? ->","completion":" My colleague and I were at a trade fair where various suppliers had stands. After looking around for a while, we happened to pass by Huma's stand and met Roberto. We both thought that Huma looked very attractive and quickly fell into conversation with Roberto, who ran through Huma with us. We’d already been talking for quite some time about how we should be on the look-out for software that could handle all the HR stuff: a simple, beautiful tool that you wanted to work with. The overview we got and the price we were going to pay made it easy for us to make the switch. We’d hardly got outside the exhibition hall before we’d cancelled the agreement with our old supplier and signed up with Huma!\n"}
{"prompt":"Were there any particular causes of irritation that made you want to introduce a new system?  ->","completion":" All the outdated systems that did not make work easier. We met various relevant parties and tested a number of systems, but we were never completely satisfied. A system designed for companies with several thousand employees in different countries is not really suitable for us, as we’re far from that size. We wanted a simple, modern system, where we didn't have to spend an unnecessary amount of time finding what we were looking for. A system where we could choose for ourselves what we needed and what we didn't. \n"}
{"prompt":"Why did you want an HR system? ->","completion":" After several years with various Excel and Word documents, we simply had enough. We realised that were spending unnecessary amounts of time and energy looking for the right document when we needed information or needed to update information. This naturally resulted in people starting to get a bit sloppy with things that were 'not that important' right now, which wasn’t good.\n"}
{"prompt":"What’s the process for a new employee starting with you?  ->","completion":" We’ve all had our first day of work at a workplace at some time or another, felt nervous and stressed about meeting new colleagues, learning new routines and work tasks. So that people starting with us can avoid feeling too much of this, we start our onboarding plan well in advance of the first day of work. This is a plan that starts with early contact with your immediate manager or colleague, who makes sure that everything feels okay and that you get the time you need. When the first day of work finally arrives, you get to greet all your new colleagues and introduce yourself. The in-house onboarding then starts, adapted to whichever role the person is employed in. We try to make you feel welcome from the first moment, making sure you know who you can talk to if you have any questions or need help with anything. Our culture is characterised by flexibility and openness and everyone is allowed to have their say. No one's ideas are better or worse than anyone else's. And one person can be good at many things, but together we are the best!\n"}
{"prompt":"Does Huma have templates? ->","completion":" Huma is designed to make your working day easier. Access all the templates you need to make meetings and employee interviews a little less stressful and a great deal smoother. Available templates include those for annual\/quarterly employee appraisal interviews, follow-up meetings for (long-term) sick leave, informal 1 on 1 interviews, 30-, 60- and 90-day onboarding interviews, board meetings and much more. You can also adapt the templates to suit your company or departments.\n"}
{"prompt":"How do you create an invite in Huma? ->","completion":" When you send out your interview invites, they are easy to add to your calendar – fuss-free and easy to see. You’ll have to try very hard to forget. Your pathway then becomes as simple as one-click invitation → check the calendar → meet up for the chat.\n"}
{"prompt":"How do you determine the agenda for an employee appraisal ->","completion":" Employee appraisal interviews yield the most value if each employee is also allowed to provide input to the basis for discussion. Before the interview takes place, you and your employee fill out your respective templates, evaluating each other's efforts and commenting on what you need to work on. That way, the way forward becomes much clearer.\n"}
{"prompt":"How do you write minutes in a meeting ->","completion":" Write minutes from the interview as you go along. This avoids anything being unclear and you both end up with a clear plan for measures to be taken, things that need to be worked on and whether or not there is anything that needs to stop now. Put the minutes in the personnel folder so that everything is stored securely and access is restricted to the parties concerned.\n"}
{"prompt":"Why did you want an HR system? ->","completion":" We wanted a system that could give our employees digital access to all relevant work-related documents with secure storage in one place. We also liked that our employment agreements could be based on a template given legal quality-assurance by lawyers. After all, there are always small changes occurring in employment law, and making mistakes you are not aware of is easily done.. Then it’s good to start with a template that is continuously quality-assured and up-to-date. As I said, we also have many employees from different countries, so the fact that Huma supports several languages is a real plus.\n"}
{"prompt":"What made you decide to choose Huma?  ->","completion":" We have previous experience with what may be considered larger companies, but we liked the ‘start-up feel’ of Huma. There was a new way of thinking and a focus on how the digital platform could contribute to good communication with all our employees, most of whom are out in the field. In addition to that, we had the opportunity of contributing what we wanted, so that we became part of the development team in a sense. And we’re really appreciative of systems that can be developed together.In the end, though, we really got a good feel for the people we met when they showed us the system. They seemed genuinely interested and knowledgeable. It gave us the feeling they really understood the issues we might encounter and had the solutions ready. After that, we’ve been able to put forward lots of suggestions for improvement that have not only been received with thanks but implemented too. That really creates trust and strong ties!\n"}
{"prompt":"Now that you have used Huma for a little while, what has surprised you?  ->","completion":" Nothing, and that's good. We’ve got what we expected; we always thought it would make our workday lives easier, and it has. Having said that, we must admit that the means of securing digital signatures from all relevant parties in an employment agreement was incredibly flexible and made the process much easier. Not having to send documents back and forth saved us masses of time. That was a positive surprise!\n"}
{"prompt":"Why did you want an HR system?  ->","completion":" With system support for HR, you get control. And if you have control, there is more room for Rock ‘n' Roll! For us, this means that the People & Culture role can focus on the most important thing, that’s to say People & Culture, instead of administration and trying to remember which Excel sheet belonged to what. Another effect, bringing further value, is that everyone is reassured that all documents, agreements, policies, processes for onboarding, offboarding, re-boarding, conversations and everything else have their place and can be found in one place. Everything to do with HR must be simple in order to be able to focus on what is really most important, that is to say colleagues, relationships, commitment, leadership and development. We want our People & Culture role to focus on what it’s best at, and not need to spend unnecessary amounts of time on administration. That’s why it feels particularly good to be able to automate a whole load of administrative processes with Huma.\n"}
{"prompt":"You did extensive research before choosing Huma. What was the reason for your choice? ->","completion":" We were looking for a system that was safe, easy and fun to use. We found that in Huma. What decided the question was their way of developing the product together with their customers by means of feedback. That’s also one thing that has surprised us after we started using Huma: how incredibly quickly it goes from providing feedback to the platform being developed. Put simply, the speed of the pace of development, the new updates and functions that are released following feedback from users. We also liked the top-quality support we got from you. Yes, Huma really ticked all the boxes for us.\n"}
{"prompt":"What is it like for a new employee to start with you? ->","completion":" I only started a few months ago myself and it's been absolutely great! It feels completely natural to be included in the entire QB team right away. From the first moment really, and I've never experienced that before! Throughout the whole experience, you feel that it should be easy to start with us, and with a personal touch. This feels real and emanates from the leaders during both pre-boarding and onboarding. You are invited to events, for example, before you have even had your first day at work. One of the traditions is that you have to have a foosball match against Azddin, who is the founder and CEO of Quickbutik.\n"}
{"prompt":"Why did you end up with Huma and Teamtailor? ->","completion":" We did a lot of research into the various tools available on the market. A lot of the vendors had nice features, but the user experience was not good. It was really important to us that the tool we chose be easy to use. Especially considering that we wanted the employees to access these tools and use them for themselves, to get high adoption, the tools needed to be user friendly. With Huma we found a solution that met our needs. It was easy to use, it looks great, and the integration with Teamtailor was also important to us.\n"}
{"prompt":"Now that you have used Huma for a little while, tell me how it's been? ->","completion":" The start up process was very easy once we understood what we were doing. We were a little confused at first, just working with a new tool, but with a little bit of help from Torkil, our contact person at Huma, we got up to speed quickly. We chose Teamtailor for all our recruitment needs, it is also very easy to use, and the functionality around screening a candidate across different teams has proved very useful. We hire experts in very specific areas, and for the HR team it’s a great help that you can easily invite other team members into the hiring process and screen a candidate together. Also the integration with Huma makes the rest of the process very breezy for us in the HR team. Once I give a candidate the “hire stamp” in Teamtailor, all the information is seamlessly transferred to Huma, and the onboarding process begins. It's actually one of the best features of Huma, in my mind! Another feature that has surprised us in its usefulness is the “News” section. We didn’t think it would be as useful as it has proved to be. We have a lot of events at our company, and a lot of information needs to be communicated in connection with these. The News feature allows us to gather all of that information in one place, where everyone can find it. The integration with Slack lets us alert everyone that a new article has been published, and they actually find what they are looking for! All of this in the end means that people actually show up for the events that we put a lot of effort into, and that makes all the difference!\n"}
{"prompt":"What made you want an HR system in the first place? ->","completion":" We wanted to achieve a better structure for our documents and processes. Previously, we used an ordinary PC filing system and teams. That worked for a while, but it quickly became unwieldy and was clearly not sustainable. Another thing is that Huma has helped us to a better structure for our onboarding processes. And that, of course, is very important to us.\n"}
{"prompt":"When we talk about onboarding and recruitment, you use Teamtailor for your own recruitment. Can you tell us a little about how that has worked for you? ->","completion":" It’s been great! It has systematised the process and made managing the candidates much easier. The fact that Teamtailor is integrated with several other systems such as reference apps and customer integration, for example, makes the whole process easier and clearer. In addition, it’s a secure platform for personal data transfer in line with the GDPR regulations.\n"}
{"prompt":"What was the reason you wanted an HR system in the first place? ->","completion":" We wanted an orderly, manageable way to store and handle all sensitive personnel documents. It was a real bottleneck before, and particularly bearing GDPR in mind, it was a good idea to make a proper job of it. We noticed the problems more and more as we grew, and when we passed 50 employees, there was no question of putting it off. Most of our employees have around 3 separate documents each related to their employment. That means about 150 documents when we rounded 50 employees (LOTS of documents!). Before, only the CEO had access to all employment documents (and not all were necessarily sorted\/filed correctly), so every time anything came up, the middle managers had to go to the CEO and I had to search for the correct documents. I guess that added up to about 2-3 hours a month. That doesn’t sound much, but it’s a very unnecessary amount of time for a manager, as well as the fact that such ‘unnecessary’ inquiries otherwise interrupt work flow. It’s also more professional that all employees are able to find their own papers when needed, as well as being safer regarding GDPR.\n"}
{"prompt":"What made you choose Huma? ->","completion":" We liked you being a Norwegian start-up, because we are too! We have a very good impression of you as a team: You are very helpful and accommodating. We have found you responsive to input and liked your focus on developing what people need and not all kinds of other things. Not only that, Huma was cheaper than some of the competitors. Huma is user-friendly and intuitive to use. That’s important to us. It’s also adapted to Norwegian conditions, and with the extra adaptations for English and Danish personnel, it makes it easy for us to scale. We’ve been using Huma for a while now, and we have been surprised at how incredibly fast you launch and come up with new things! You deliver new features when you say they’ll be ready. As a tech company too, we know that things can get in the way or that you have to prioritize differently from time to time. But with Huma, we want new things, and they actually arrive very quickly!\n"}
{"prompt":"As CEO, what do you get out of an HR system? ->","completion":" I get everything in order! All the contracts in one place; I can search for employees easily. I also use the absence module a lot to see who’s away and who’s at work. And i have a complete overview of birthdays too, so that’s nice. I also use Huma to keep track of some key figures that we measure ourselves by, gender distribution, country, etc. Now we’re going to start with our appraisal interviews and take the temperature of our culture. It will be great to be able to do this with Huma this time; much easier than before! We’ve been wanting to take the temperature for a long time, but it’s not been done because we’ve never managed to prioritise it; we’ve always thought the job so big to even get started. The great thing now is that we can simply use Huma and get started very quickly. What’s more, Huma allows us to run the same processes for our employees across several countries. It is important to create greater belonging and to come together as one company. The problem for us was that our appraisal interviews have been very sporadic and lacking in structure, so some middle managers have had them (with their own questions)while it’s quite likely that others have not had them at all. In essence, we have previously spent too little time on this, but now it will be the same for everyone in the organisation, more professional and more transparent. This is important for our employees.\n"}
{"prompt":"You have integrated Huma with Teamtailor, why did you do that? ->","completion":" Well, we’re a growing company and actually recruiting all the time. The fact that Huma is well integrated with Teamtailor makes the admin work related to recruitment much easier. We get employees directly into Huma without anyone having to spend a calorie transferring the information. In addition, it reduces the risk of information getting lost or misplaced.The integration probably saves us a total of around 1-2 hours per new employee. Before, the manager had to add the new employee to Huma and ask him or her to register and then ‘plot’ in all their info. Now everything goes seamlessly! When new employees start, this gives a much more professional impression of Eyr, and it is important in itself that everything is already in place.\n"}
{"prompt":"Why is vacation important?  ->","completion":" Vacation is important for several reasons. Firstly, it provides us with the opportunity to rest and recharge. After a period of work or study, we need time to relax, reduce stress levels, and take care of our physical and mental health. Vacation allows us to unwind, get enough sleep, and engage in activities that bring us joy and relaxation. Additionally, vacation helps maintain a healthy work-life balance. It gives us time to explore our interests, spend time with friends and family, and nurture our personal relationships. It allows us to participate in activities we enjoy, explore new places, and experience different cultures. Vacation has also been shown to be beneficial for productivity. When we take the time to rest and recharge, we come back to work with renewed energy and motivation. We often become more focused, creative, and efficient after a good vacation period. Vacation also gives us the opportunity to reflect on our goals and priorities, and perhaps set a new plan for the future. Overall, vacation contributes to our overall well-being and quality of life. It provides us with a well-deserved break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and allows us to create memories and experiences that last a lifetime. Vacation also helps strengthen our personal and social bonds, giving us time to focus on ourselves and our loved ones.\n"}
{"prompt":"Where do I see who is away, and how can I plan more efficiently? ->","completion":" On the dashboard, everyone will have a clear overview of who is currently away and when for the next couple of weeks. Under 'Absence', they will also find a fantastic and user-friendly calendar that provides a perfect overview of who's away and when. This calendar view is also accessible under each team or location in Huma, guaranteeing seamless planning and coordination within teams.\n"}
{"prompt":"How many days do I have left of my balance? ->","completion":" With Huma, employees have real-time access to how many days they have used and how many days they have left. This comes into play when registering your vacation, empowering you with accurate information at your fingertips. In addition, Huma provides a great overview of all registered days for various types of absences, allowing you to easily monitor your balance for each specific category. \n"}
{"prompt":"How can I request vacation? ->","completion":" From the Huma App everyone can easily request vacation. It’s super simple and makes the process a breeze, saving valuable time and you can do it from anywhere. When requesting vacation you will get a clear overview of how many days you have left in this period.\n"}
{"prompt":"How does the approval work? ->","completion":" When employees submit vacation requests, managers receive instant notifications and can easily review and approve or deny requests, ensuring timely responses and allowing employees to plan their vacations effectively. When handling the requests you will get all the information you need such as dates, the vacation balance (according to their vacation policy), and additional notes.\n"}
{"prompt":"How do the different policies work? Does it fit my company?  ->","completion":" Do you have employees with different rules? Perhaps there is a difference in the number of vacation days they can take. Maybe employees over 60 years old should have an extra week of vacation? Or perhaps you have employees in other countries where their vacation period doesn't start on January 1st? This is where Huma's absence policy comes to your aid. With an unlimited number of policies that can be assigned to different employees, all employees will receive the rules that apply to them. This simplifies the HR process, reduces administration, and ensures consistent management of absences - regardless of the needs you have.\n"}
{"prompt":"Can you help me with all the questions I get about holiday pay? ->","completion":" In the Nordics, a lot of people will receive holiday pay before the summer, and this tends to be a bit of a hassle for HR. It's tempting to just ask HR, 'When do I receive my holiday pay?' - but Huma has a solution that will minimize the request load. With a digital Handbook, you can gather all the information about such matters. Write a short topic about holiday pay, share it with those who should have access to it, and send out a push notification. Everyone with access will get notified and can simply open the app to get the answer right away.You can also pin important topics, and they will be highlighted on the dashboard and in the Handbook, making them more accessible to the users. \n"}
{"prompt":"Can I get the data from other systems? ->","completion":" Yes! You can either export all absence to an excel sheet, or you can use our Webhooks integration which allows you to pull absence data from Huma, and into basically any systems out there, in real-time. Read more about Webhooks here and check out the knowledge base for details.\n"}
{"prompt":"Azure AD integration ->","completion":" Exciting news! The integration between Huma and Azure AD is finally here! We know many of you already have a Microsoft account, and with this integration, you can now benefit from a robust identity management solution that simplifies user management and strengthens security. Gone are the days of manual data entry and upkeep! With automated synchronization and user creation, your HR and IT staff can save time and focus on more strategic tasks. Plus, any changes or updates made to a user's information in Huma will automatically be reflected in Azure AD, ensuring that user data is always accurate and up-to-date. And - did you know, it only takes a couple of minutes to set up?\n"}
{"prompt":"Add competence faster ->","completion":" You will now be able to add competence to multiple people at once. Having 10 employees going to the same course? Or adding the same skill to a lot of people? No worries - 2 clicks and you’ll have it!\n"}
{"prompt":"Find people with a certain level of competence ->","completion":" Huma streamlines the process of identifying and connecting with the right experts within your organization, making it easy to get the help you need when you need it. Whether you need a Java expert to help with a project or a skilled translator to communicate with clients in Japan, Huma has you covered. You can even filter on competence level.\n"}

{"prompt":"How can I make the onboarding processes efficient and reusable? ->","completion":" Efficient and reusable_ENTo have an effective onboarding process, you need to structure all tasks that need to be done from when a new employee has signed the contract to when they are well underway in their work. This can take anywhere from 6 to 12 months. In Huma you can create multiple templates to get a more automated onboarding process. This will save you a lot of time and a big plus is that it can be reused to get a consistent process. You can even combine templates if you want one common template for the whole company and one specialised for specific teams or roles. For instance: If you have tasks that need to be done in every onboarding - add them to a separate template and combine them with the more specific templates.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can I present the new hire to everyone in our company? ->","completion":" Present new hire_ENA good practice is to write an article in Huma where the new hire has answered some questions about themselves and what they will do in the company. This way, both you as a company and your employees will be prepared to welcome the new hire and already know a bit about them before their first day of work. This will make the new hire feel more included before their first day of work, and can also serve as an icebreaker during the  irst period as a new hire.Tips: Articles can either be shared with everyone or specific teams or locations.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can I make the onboarding process welcoming and engaging for the new hire? ->","completion":" Welcoming and egaging_ENWe recommend that the structured onboarding template in Huma also includes the ‘soft’ tasks in an onboarding. Assign an Onboarding buddy who should be responsible for some extra follow up with the new hire in the first 4-5 months. You should also include the new hire in social gatherings already before their first workday. This is called preboarding, and tasks concerning this can be assigned to the Onboarding buddy or HR.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can I ensure the new hire understands the company guidelines and procedures? ->","completion":" Guidelines_ENIf you use the handbook module in Huma, you may want a task in the onboarding template for the new hire to read the most important topics in the handbook. You can invite the new hire to Huma a week before they start. This way, they can also update their personal profile and already get a sense of the different teams and people in the organization before their first day on the job.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can I provide ongoing feedback and support to the new hire? ->","completion":" Ongoing feedback_ENSet up tasks in the template for some meetings: HR should have a startup meeting with the new hire to see if they have any questions and make sure they understand the company guidelines. The supervisor should have regular meetings with the new hire the first 6 months to make sure everything runs smoothly and help the new hire continue to grow and develop in their role.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can I streamline and improve our onboarding processes? ->","completion":" Streamline_ENHuma has given you a good start with our onboarding template, but there’s always room for improvement. At the end of every onboarding, have a review meeting (template is in our Meeting module) where the employee can evaluate the onboarding process. Make sure to update your onboarding templates with the new insights.\n"}
{"prompt":"How can I use SSO (single sign on) to log in? ->","completion":" If you are already logged in with your Google or Microsoft account in the browser, then it is easiest to choose that when logging in to Huma too. \n"}
{"prompt":"How can I automatically import new employees from my recruitment system? ->","completion":" If you use Teamtailor, this is easy.
